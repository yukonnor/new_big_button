Refactored Code &amp; Documentation for LMNC's Big Button. See his original post here: https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/big-button

## background
While playing with my synth, I thought it'd be handy if I could create rhythms by recording button taps. The tap pattern would then be looped in a sequence. While looking around for inspiration / existing hardware that accomplished this, I stumbled upon Look Mom No Computer's "Big Button". Woo!

## updates
I went through " "'s code and refactored it a bit to clean it up and make it easier for me to understand. I also added comments to help me understand what was taking place. This file is named " ". 

I also created an alternaitve version that gets rid of some of the features and adds some others. It goes from 6 ouputs to 4 (I only have so many things to trigger) and scraps Fill, Shift, .It adds a bank LED to let you know which bank you're on for each channel.
